# Study Plan

We recognize that each intern will have a different internship experience where some may experience greater intensity at the beginning of internship, others may experience a heavier workload at the end of internship, and others may experience something in between. As such, we are flexible with when folks complete thier Unit 4 materials during internship.

To ensure that everyone recognizes the scope of work in Unit 4 and has a plan in place to spread the unit coursework over their internship, we ask all students to submit a study plan with proposed completion dates for each of the required elements. 

Please check out [the Post-Classroom CS Fundamentals Site](https://sites.google.com/adadevelopersacademy.org/adacorehub/homework-projects/cs-fundamentals) for further details and current information specific to your cohort.

## Filling out the plan

Details of the Unit 4 requirements will have been shared in the Unit 4 kickoff and are listed at the top of the study plan template (linked below). The study plan template provides week by week placeholders that folks can fill out to create a schedule for tackling the Unit 4 materials that will work for their internship and workload. 

As you fill out your study plan and prepare to turn it in, please:
- Reach out to your 1-1 with any questions about your personal study plan.
- Check the file permissions on your study plan and make it is viewable by others before submission. 
- Submit a link to your study plan in Learn within a week of the Unit 4 kickoff meeting.

## Need to Change your Study Plan?

We expect that many interns will need to adjust their initial study plan. If you are altering any milestones we ask that you update your study plan and reach out to your 1-1 instructor, to give the instructional team awareness of your progress and schedule changes. 

## Unit 4 Deadline 

All Unit 4 work must be submitted to Learn by Friday of the last week of internship.
