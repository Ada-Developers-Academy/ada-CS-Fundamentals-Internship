# Algorithms - Instructor Guidelines

## Recommendations for Students
Much of this material should be review for students. It is recommended that when studying this material, students first skim each lesson (except for dynamic programming). Students can use the challenge questions to gauge personal understanding of the topic. 

Students can then go back and read in more detail the lessons in which they feel they need additional review in and re-attempt the challenge questions.

Dynamic programming should be new to most students and should be reviewed in the most detail. Sliding window technique should be viewed as truly optional.
