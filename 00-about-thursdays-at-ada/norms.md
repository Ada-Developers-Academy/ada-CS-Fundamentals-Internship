# Thursdays at Ada Norms

* **Attendance at Thursdays at Ada is required for graduation** from the program. 
  * However, we understand that sometimes things come up and external circumstances may cause you to miss a session. If you need to miss a CS Fundamentals or Career Services lesson, please send an email to [absent_internship@adadevelopersacademy.org
  ](mailto:absent_internship@adadevelopersacademy.org
  ) in advance where possible.
* CS Fundamentals assignments are a required part of your continuing education and graduation requirements. **You need to complete 7 of the 8 exercises for CS Fundamentals**. If you need assistance please contact your instructors and make use of the TAs. 
* Additionally, you will occasionally be asked to submit things for the Career Development side. These are also required.
* Career Development facilitators and speakers are volunteers who are excited to share their expertise with you. With that in mind, please keep your video on during Thursdays at Ada sessions (barring extenuating circumstances), and try to stay as engaged as possible (answering questions, responding in the chat, participating in interactive breakout sessions or sharing out your thoughts if you are comfortable).
