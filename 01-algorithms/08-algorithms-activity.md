## Newman-Conway Sequence

We will go over the recursive solution with and without Dynamic Programming in class. 

Afterwards, you will work in groups to complete an Iterative Solution using Dynamic Programming.

### Class Livecode

Follow along in the following Replit as we livecode a recursive solution with and without Dynamic Programming: [Newman-Conway Recursively](https://replit.com/@adadev/Newman-Conway-Recursive)


### Small Group Work

Fork the following Replit to work on in small groups: [Newman-Conway Iteratively with DP](https://replit.com/@adadev/Newman-Conway-Iterative)
