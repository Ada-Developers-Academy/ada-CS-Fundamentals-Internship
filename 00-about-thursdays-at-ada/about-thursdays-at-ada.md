### Reverse Classroom

CS Fundamentals is taught in a [flipped-classroom](https://omerad.msu.edu/teaching/teaching-strategies/27-teaching/162-what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model) style.  Students are assigned a week prior to review a markdown lesson with accompanying video lesson and slides.  Then in class or online session students ask questions review concepts and work on exercises.  Students are also given time to work toward a weekly programming project.

### CS Fun Recorded Sessions

All the CS Fundamentals Online sessions are recorded in Panopto.
