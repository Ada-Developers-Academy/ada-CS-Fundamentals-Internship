# Introduction

CS Fundamentals is a continuation of the data structure and algorithms-focused CS Fundamentals topics encountered during the classroom phase. Studying data structures and algorithms accomplishes several goals:

1. It helps us apply our programming skills to new and challenging classes of problems.
2. It helps us develop our algorithmic thinking.
3. It helps us build a shared language and understanding with other programming professionals.
4. It helps us prepare for technical interviews.
