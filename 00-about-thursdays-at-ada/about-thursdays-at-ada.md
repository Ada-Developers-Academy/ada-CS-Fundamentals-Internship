## CS Fundamentals

In Computer Science fundamentals students learn the following concepts and data structures:

- [Linked Lists](../02-linked-lists/01-linked-lists.md)
- [Binary Search Trees](../03-Binary-Search-Trees/01-Ordered-Collections-Of-Data.md)
- [Graphs: BFS & DFS](../08-graphs/01-graphs.md)
- [Graphs: Dijkstra](../09-graphs-p2/01-graphs-review.md)
- [Algorithms](../07-algorithms/algorithms.md) such as Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming & Greedy Algorithms

### Reverse Classroom

CS Fundamentals is taught in a [flipped-classroom](https://omerad.msu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=162:what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model&catid=27:teaching) style. Students are assigned a week prior to review a markdown lesson with accompanying video lesson and slides. In class students are expected to ask questions, review concepts, and work on exercises in groups. Students are also given time to engage in a mock interview with a peer.
