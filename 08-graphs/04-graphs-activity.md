# Activity:  Problem Solving

## Goal

Our goal is to practice using breadth first search and depth first search to solve graph problems.

## Livecode - Number of Provinces

As a class we will walk through solving the Number of Provinces problem. 

If you would like to follow along the livecode, you can fork the Repl here: [Graph Activity Repl](https://replit.com/@adadev/graphs-practice#README.md)

### Breakout Rooms - Number of Provinces Part 2

In small groups of 3-4 students, re-implement the problem in the replit using the opposite approach that we used during the group livecode in class (either BFS or DFS).

**One student** should *fork* the following Repl and share the collaboration link with the rest of the team. If you coded along with the livecode, comment out the class solution before beginning your small group solution. [Graph Activity Repl](https://replit.com/@adadev/graphs-practice)


#### Exercise

If you finish early, you can take an early break or get started on the project with instructor support in the main room available.
