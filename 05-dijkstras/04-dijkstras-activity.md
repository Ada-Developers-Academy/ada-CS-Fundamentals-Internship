# Activity:  Problem Solving

## Goal

Our goal is to practice using Dijkstra's Algorithm to solve shortest/least costly path problems.

# As a Class - Cheapest Flight Livecode

As a class we will introduce the interview problem, discuss test cases, why Dijkstra's is a good fit for solving this problem, and possible modifications we may need to make to Dijkstra's to solve this problem.

Follow along in the following Replit as we livecode the function in class:

* [Cheapest Flight Solution](https://replit.com/@adadev/Cheapest-Flight-Instructor-Solution#dijkstra/cheapest_flight.py)

### Breakout Rooms - Minimum Effort Path Pseudocode

In small groups of 3-4 students, pseudocode a solution to the Minimum Effort Path problem in the replit. Get as far as you can, asking for instructor assistance when needed. You _do not_ need to finish the pseudocode or implement the problem.

**One student** should *fork* the following Repl and share the collaboration link with the rest of the team.  [Minimum Effort Path Activity Repl](https://replit.com/@adadev/Minimum-Effort-Path-Activity)

#### Exercise

If you finish early, try implementing your pseudocode and getting all of the tests to pass!
