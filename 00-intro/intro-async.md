# Introduction - Asynchronous Unit 4

CS Fundamentals is a continuation of the data structure and algorithms-focused CS Fundamentals topics encountered during the classroom phase. Studying data structures and algorithms accomplishes several goals:

1. It helps us apply our programming skills to new and challenging classes of problems.
2. It helps us develop our algorithmic thinking.
3. It helps us build a shared language and understanding with other programming professionals.
4. It helps us prepare for technical interviews.

For more information about the structure and expectations of the post-classroom CS Fundamentals material, please visit the post-classroom CS Fundamentals Site.

## Unit 4 is Asynchronous

You may see reference to previously used language related to the classroom or working in small groups throughout the content in Learn, in recordings, or in the repositories that are linked in the lessons. Unit 4 is now entirely self-directed and asynchronous. This means that you will work through the materials, problem sets, and any additional practice exercises at your own pace and you should disregard any reference to the classroom or working in groups. 

While we will not be facilitating group work time, please feel free to organize amongst yourselves and work on Unit 4 or review your solutions to any problems together.
