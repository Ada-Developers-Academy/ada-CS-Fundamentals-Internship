# Lesson Plan

Dynamic Programming is a _hard_ concept for students to understand. It will likely take repeated exposures to the strategy. This lesson is intended to give students several chances to see and solve dynamic programming problems.  If students only understand the memoization strategy and are able to solve problems like Fibonacci numbers, this is a good place to start.

## Lesson Goals

We want students to:

- Be able to explain divide & conquer, greedy and dynamic programming strategies
- Identify algorithms using these strategies
- Solve coding problems using divide & conquer, greedy and dynamic programming strategies

## Review Heaps Project - 10 minutes

Start off the lesson by welcoming students to the class and note attendance. You can use the Airtable to record attendance The [C16 Airtable](https://airtable.com/appkfPQ769uxQLSei/tbl6oiA8ZG1wKUonM/viwgf4wesbLFMlg1L?blocks=hide) is linked.

Take a moment to review any questions from the Heaps project and allow students to present their solutions.

## Students may not want to do this

Students can be a bit shy, but you can contact specific students ahead of time asking them to be ready to present, "because you find their solution interesting."  Being prepared helps with student confidence.

## Algorithmic Strategies Introduction - 10 minutes

Then follow the 1st part of the [activity](./01-algorithms.md) reviewing divide & conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming and answer questions about the coding examples.

Specifically reinforce:

- How to identify the strategies.
- Where to use them.
- Terminology such a memoization, and recursion

## Livecodes - 30 minutes

In the livecode walk through both the Newman Conway problem and Word Break.  Word Break is intentionally similar to the in class group exercise.

Remember to:

- Try to get students to navigate as you type.  
- Cause a bug, and try to promote student ideas to fix it.
- Model how to use the tests and print statements.

## Coding Activity - 45 minutes

Break students into breakout rooms to practice the replit. The replit has a suggested solution in pseudocode which is a good chance for students to discuss how to convert it to code.

Iterate through the breakout rooms answering questions as you go.
