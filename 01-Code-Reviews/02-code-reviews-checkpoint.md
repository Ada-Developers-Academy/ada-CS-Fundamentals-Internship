# Code Reviews Exercise

For today's exercise take a look at the [Code Reviews Repo](https://github.com/ada-c13/code-reviews).

## Reviewing a PR

You will be broken into groups (breakout rooms).  Each breakout room will review a single pull request.

As you review the PR ask:

- Do I understand what this code is doing? (Readability)
- Are there things wrong with this code? (Correctness)
- Are there changes (Improvements) I can suggest to make the code more:
  - Readable
  - Efficient
  - Flexible

## Review the reviews

After you review, then look at the comments from your teammates and ask:

- Is this comment correct?
- Does the comment clearly communicate the point?
- Is the comment kind and collaborative?

Discuss the PR and identify:

1.  Is there any comment which is ambiguous or incorrect? 
2.  Could any of the comments be percieved as unkind?
3.  Is any comment particularly noteworthy?

## Questions

You can discuss these as **each of you** answer these questions together.
