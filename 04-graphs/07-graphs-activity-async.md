# Additional Practice

## Independent or Small Group Work

Feel free to complete this additional practice independently or in small groups. If you are working in a small group, have one person fork and clone the repository so that you can all work together on the implementation. Invite the other members of your group to the repo so that you can all push changes to the same repo and see each other's work.

- Time box no more than twenty minutes to implement a solution to each of the following repos.
- If your entire group is feeling stuck, start by brainstorming what kind of loop you may want to use in your solution. Consider the base cases, how you can add the base cases to the memo (for the memoization) and the end condition for your loop.
- Explain what is making you feel stuck and try to work through your questions with others!

## Class Livecode Recording: Bipartition Graph

Follow along with the Class Discussions recording as we livecode the function in class: 
* [Bipartition Graph](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/bipartition_graph_livecode)
  * Check out the `solution` branch in the repo to see a version of the Livecode implementation

## Graph Variations

- Spend twenty minutes implementing a solution for each of the following repos. 

Fork one of the following repos to work on in: 
* [Convert Graph](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/convert_graph_activity)
* [DFS with Adjacency Matrix](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/dfs-with-adjacency-matrix)
* [Repeat BFS](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/repeat-bfs-activity/)

Check out the `solution` branch in each repo to see a version of a working implementation
