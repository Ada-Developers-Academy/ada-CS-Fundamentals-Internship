## Unit 4 is Asynchronous

You may see reference to previously used language related to the classroom or working in small groups throughout the content in Learn, in recordings, or in the repositories that are linked in the lessons. Unit 4 is now entirely self-directed and asynchronous. This means that you will work through the materials, problem sets, and any additional practice exercises at your own pace and you should disregard any reference to the classroom or working in groups. 

While we will not be facilitating group work time, please feel free to organize amongst yourselves and work on Unit 4 or review your solutions to any problems together.

## Bipartition Graph

In the following repo, implement a function `possible_bipartition` that determines whether or not the nodes in a graph can be placed into two groups, where no two neighbors are in the same group: 
* [Bipartition Graph Livecode Start](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/bipartition_graph_livecode)
  * Check out the `solution` branch in the repo to see a version of the Livecode implementation


## Graph Variations

- Spend twenty minutes implementing a solution for each of the following repos. 
- As always, if you are feeling stuck, we invite you to come to office hours, ask questions in Slack in #study-hall, or consult an AI tool to help you brainstorm an approach without providing a solution.


Fork one of the following repos to work on in small groups: 
* [Convert Graph](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/convert_graph_activity)
* [DFS with Adjacency Matrix](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/dfs-with-adjacency-matrix)
* [Repeat BFS](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/repeat-bfs-activity/)

Check out the `solution` branch in each repo to see a version of a working implementation
