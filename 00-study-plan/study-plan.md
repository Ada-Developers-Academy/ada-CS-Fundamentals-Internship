# Thursdays at Ada Study Plan

 Thursdays at Ada deadlines are flexible. We recognize that each intern will have a different internship experience where some may experience greater intensity at the beginning of internship, others may experience a heavier workload at the end of internship, and others may experience something in between.

 To ensure that you recognize the scope of work we are asking you to complete and have a plan in place to complete the Thursdays at Ada course, we ask that you submit a study plan with proposed completion dates for each of the required elements.
 
 See more details about each plan in your section specific study guide:

 ## Completion Options
There are three basic paths to complete Thursdays at Ada requirements.

 ### Path A
Path A keeps pace with CS Fundamentals live sessions and will ensure you have covered all topics by the end of the third month of internship which is when many folks choose to actively begin their job search. Path A follows the pattern of learning a new CS Fundamentals topic and completing an interview practice question every two weeks. 

Path A also includes ample time to review topics during the last two months of internship and practice applying them. Following Path A, we hope students will feel very solid on all Thursdays at Ada topics by graduation and will be able to independently apply them. 

Accelerate students: we recommend that you choose Path A or a modified version of it as your internship is shorter. Keep in mind that you have covered Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees, and Graphs already. 

 ### Path B
Path B will allow you to dedicate most of your first two months solely to internship. We do recommend keeping up with career development sessions as they occur since preparation for career development sessions is optional and you do have the 5 hours on Thursdays set aside. We also recommend you complete one mock interview on a topic from the classroom phase early on to familiarize yourself with the format. 

Path B will introduce all topics to you by the end of internship and allow you to complete all CS Fundamentals Graduation requirements with a week long buffer by the deadline. You will review each new topic and accompanying problem set by the review session. By graduation, you may feel that you need additional review of the CS Fun topics but should have a solid foundation to conduct your review independently.

If you are able to read through the new topic material (without completing the problem set questions) during your first two months of internship , we would highly recommend you do so that the topics are not completely unfamiliar when you start intensive work on CS Fundamentals material.

 ### Path C
 Choose your own completion dates by filling out and submitting [your personal study plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uCUKu9sZLUSbxsUVobnf8d2EaudXIQxqFpSRhhYE2jU/edit?usp=sharing)
