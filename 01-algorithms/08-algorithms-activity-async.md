## Unit 4 is Asynchronous

You may see reference to previously used language related to the classroom or working in small groups throughout the content in Learn, in recordings, or in the repositories that are linked in the lessons. Unit 4 is now entirely self-directed and asynchronous. This means that you will work through the materials, problem sets, and any additional practice exercises at your own pace and you should disregard any reference to the classroom or working in groups. 

While we will not be facilitating group work time, please feel free to organize amongst yourselves and work on Unit 4 or review your solutions to any problems together.

## Newman-Conway Sequence

There are several approaches for implementing a solution to the Newan-Conway Sequence problem. We could write an iterative solution using dynamic programming or a recursive solution with or without dynamic programming as well. 

Fork and clone the [Newman Conway Sequence Iterative](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/newman-conway-iterative) repository. Implement an iterative solution using dynamic programming to generate a list of the first N numbers of Newman-Conway's Sequence. You can find more details in the repository. 

As always, if you are feeling stuck, we invite you to come to office hours, ask questions in Slack in #study-hall, or consult an AI tool to help you brainstorm an approach without providing a solution.

### Solution

After you have had a chance to work on your own solution(s) to the Newman-Conway Sequence, check out the `solution` branch in the following repositories to see our working implementations:

- [Newman-Conway Iteratively with DP solution branch](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/newman-conway-iterative/tree/solution)
- [Newman-Conway Recursively solution branch](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/newman-conway-recursive/tree/solution)

### Previous Recordings 

If you would like to review a livecode walkthrough of the recursive dynamic programming approach, please see the recording below. To see all the recordings related to Algorithmic Approaches, please consult the [Class Discussion](./09-algorithms-class-discussion.md) section of this topic.
