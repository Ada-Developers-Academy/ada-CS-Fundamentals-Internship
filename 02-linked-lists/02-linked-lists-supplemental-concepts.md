# Supplemental Concepts

### Pointers & References

You will often hear the terms _pointer_ and _reference_ in relation to dynamic data structures like LinkedLists.  Both terms refer to a variable which **points** to data in memory, or holds the address of another varaible in memory.  The concept is similar to a home.  The home is an object in memory, while the home's address is a _reference_ which indicates where to find the home.

In some languages like C/C++ you can manipulate memory addresses and memory directly.  In other languages, like Python, you have references which refer to objects in memory, but you cannot directly work with the memory addresses.

An example in C++

```c++
  int x = 5;
  int *ptr_x;
  ptr_x = &x;  // Assign ptr_x the value of the memory address of x.
```

We use references in Python whenever we use a Linked List since each node _refers_ to the next node in the chain and `head` refers to the 1st node in the chain.

### Memory Leaks

Is a bug in how a program manages memory.  A _memory leak_ occurs when memory that is no longer needed by the program is not released back to the operating system.  Over time, if memory is used, and not returned to the system less and less memory is available to other programs and eventually not enough memory is available to run applications.  Modern operating systems return all system memory allocated to a program when it ends.  Thus memory leaks in long-running processes like daemons can cause a system to run out of memory.

In Python, the Python interpreter manages memory for developers.  Python uses a [garbage collection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)) system which identifies memory no longer used by the application and returns it.

Consider when a node is removed from a Linked List:

<!-- source:  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41474163/singly-linked-list-remove -->


When no variable refers to a node (holding 99 in the image above) the Python garbage collector will eventually return the memory to the operating system.

```python
def remove_first(self):
    if not self.head:
        return False

    value = self.head.value
    self.head = self.head.next

    return value
```

Some languages however, place memory management on the developer.  C is one such language.  These lower-level languages give a developer more flexibility and control over low-level operations, at the cost of more responsibility and a greater likelyhood of errors.

Removing a Node from a Linked List in C

```c
void removeFirst(struct node **headRef) {
  if (*head != NULL) {
    struct node* temp = *head;
    int value = (*temp)->value;
    head = (*head)->next;
    free(temp);  // <-- Give back memory to the OS
    return value;
  }
}
```
