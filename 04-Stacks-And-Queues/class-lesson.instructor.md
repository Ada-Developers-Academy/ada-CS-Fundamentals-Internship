# Lesson Plan

Stacks and Queues are fairly straightforward data structures, but are included in the curriculum for completeness as they are a fundamental part of most computer science curriculums and often used in interviews.

They are expanded on in the project using a circular buffer. Students often find using the `%` operator to traverse an array in a circular buffer. Demonstrating it's use in a loop can be quite helpful.

## Lesson Goals

We want students to:

- Be able to explain Stacks & Queues
- Be able to explain Abstract Data Types
- Use Stacks & Queues to solve coding problems
- Use the modulus operator to traverse a circular buffer

## Review Binary Search Tree Project - 10 minutes

Start off the lesson by welcoming students to the class and note attendance. You can use the Airtable to record attendance The [C16 Airtable](https://airtable.com/appkfPQ769uxQLSei/tbl6oiA8ZG1wKUonM/viwgf4wesbLFMlg1L?blocks=hide) is linked.

Take a moment to review any questions from Binary Search Trees and allow students to present their solutions.

## Students may not want to do this

Students can be a bit shy, but you can contact specific students ahead of time asking them to be ready to present, "because you find their solution interesting."  Being prepared helps with student confidence.

## Stacks & Queues Introduction - 10 minutes

Then follow the 1st part of the [activity](./01-stacks-and-queues.md) reviewing where BSTs are useful).  

Specifically reinforce:

- The utility of Abstract Data Types
- The core stack & queue functions
- The use of the `%` operator to traverse a circular buffer

## Livecode - 20 minutes

In the livecode walk through a sample stack coding problem and the constructor/`enqueue` method:

Remember to:

- Try to get students to navigate as you type.  
- Cause a bug, and try to promote student ideas to fix it.
- Model how to use the tests and print statements.

## Coding Activity - 60 minutes

Break students into breakout rooms to practice the replit. Optionally you can talk through some pseudocode before students start working.

Iterate through the breakout rooms answering questions as you go.
