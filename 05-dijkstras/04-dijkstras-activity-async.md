# Additional Practice 

## Independent or Small Group Work

Feel free to complete this additional practice independently or in small groups. If you are working in a small group, have one person fork and clone the repository so that you can all work together on the implementation of the helper functions. Invite the other members of your group to the repo so that you can all push changes to the same repo and see each other's work.

- Time box no more than twenty minutes per function implementing a solution to the two helper functions using pseudocode or Python. 
- If you feel stuck, start by thinking about how you would solve the helper functions using pen and paper.
- Feel free to post to #study-hall! Explain what is making you feel stuck and try to work through your questions with others!
## Class Livecode Recording: Cheapest Flight

Follow along with the Class Discussions recording as we livecode the function in class: 
* [Cheapest Flight Livecode Start](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/cheapest-flight)
  * Check out the `solution` branch in the repo to see a version of the Livecode implementation

## Minimum Effort Path Pseudocode

 Pseudocode a solution to the Minimum Effort Path problem in the repo. Get as far as you can. As always, if you are feeling stuck, we invite you to come to office hours, ask questions in Slack in `#study-hall`, or consult an AI tool to help you brainstorm an approach without providing a solution.

* [Minimum Effort Path Activity](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/minimum-effort-path)
  * Check out the `solution` branch in the repo to see one version of a working implementation

Once you finish, try implementing your pseudocode and getting all of the tests to pass!
