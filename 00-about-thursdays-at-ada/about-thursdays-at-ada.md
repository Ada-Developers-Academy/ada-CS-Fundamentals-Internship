### Reverse Classroom

CS Fundamentals is taught in a [flipped-classroom](https://omerad.msu.edu/teaching/teaching-strategies/27-teaching/162-what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model) style.  Students are assigned a week prior to review a markdown lesson with accompanying video lesson and slides.  Then in class or online session students ask questions review concepts and work on exercises.  Students are also given time to work toward a weekly programming project.

### CS Fun Recorded Sessions

All the CS Fundamentals Online sessions are recorded in Panopto.

- Career Development facilitators and speakers are volunteers who are excited to share their expertise with you. With that in mind, please keep your video on during Thursdays at Ada sessions (barring extenuating circumstances), and try to stay as engaged as possible (answering questions, responding in the chat, participating in interactive breakout sessions or sharing out your thoughts if you are comfortable). 
- Thursdays at Ada is designed with you in mind and based off of feedback from previous cohortsâ€™ suggestions. The more feedback you provide on which sessions you find most helpful or not helpful will help us make this a better experience for everyone.
