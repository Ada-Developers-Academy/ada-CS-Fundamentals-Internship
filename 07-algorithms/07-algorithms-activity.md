# Activity

## Picking the Best Approach

We will go over the following questions as a class. This activity does not need to be completed ahead of time.

* id: 96750004-7b44-4ba8-ba09-9eda975603fd
* title: Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing

##### !question
**Section B**
Suppose you are given the following question:

You are given an array of integers `nums`. In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `nums` strictly increasing.

An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i + 1] for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1`. An array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.

##### !question
**Section A**

Suppose you are given the following question:

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station `i` is `stations[i]`. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `costs[i]` of gas to travel from station `i` to the next station (`i+1`). At the beginning of the journey, the tank is empty at one of the gas stations.

Assuming you need to travel around the route once, what is the index of the minimum starting gas station?

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value as a tuple.

If the target is not found in the array, return (-1,-1)

## Solving the problem

As a class, we will pick 1-2 problems to solve (as time allows). 

We will first attempt to solve the problems as a small group, then come back to talk through any sticking points and work through possible solutions as a class. 

[Section A: Gas Station](https://replit.com/@adadev/gas-station#main.py) <br>
[Section B: Minimum Operations](https://replit.com/@adadev/minimum-operations#README.md) <br>
[Shortest Common Supersequence](https://replit.com/@adadev/shortest-common-supersequence#main.py) <br>
[Find the First and Last Position of an Element](https://replit.com/@adadev/first-and-last#main.py)

### Small Group Work

Spend twenty minutes with your breakout room implementing a solution to the chosen problem using pseudocode or Python. 

One person in the group should fork the replit and share a link with the rest of the group.

If your entire group is feeling stuck, start by brainstorming some sample inputs and outputs. Try and think of at least one nominal case and two edge cases. Discuss any clarifying questions you have, and post them in your CS Fun section channel on Slack for instructor clarification.

If your entire group is still feeling lost, discuss what is making you feel stuck and ask an instructor to come to your room for help! 

### Class Livecode

After small group work, we will come back together as a class to work through a solution together. Groups may ask questions, share where they got stuck, and/or share out their solutions.
