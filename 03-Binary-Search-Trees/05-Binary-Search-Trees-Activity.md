# Livecode & Activity

## Height of a Binary Search Tree

We will go over how to implement a recursive height function for Binary Search Trees as a class.

### Class Livecode

Follow along in the following Replit as we livecode the driving function in class:

### Small Group Work: Kth Smallest Element

For your small group activity,  you will work on implementing 'Kth Smallest Element' which returns the Kth smallest element in a BST given the `root` of the tree and `k`.

- Spend twenty minutes with your breakout room implementing a solution. 
- One person in the group should fork the replit and share a link with the rest of the group.
- If your entire group is feeling stuck, start by discussing how you would solve the function using pen and paper.
- If your entire group is still feeling lost, discuss what is making you feel stuck and ask an instructor to come to your room for help!
- After small group work, we will come back together as a class to work through a solution together, as time allows. Groups may ask questions, share where they got stuck, and/or share out their solutions.
