# Activity:  Problem Solving

## Goal

Our goal is to practice using breadth first search and depth first search to solve graph problems.

# As a Class - Cheapest Flight Intro

As a class we will introduce the interview problem, discuss test cases, why Dijkstra's is a good fit for solving this problem, and possible modifications we may need to make to Dijkstra's to solve this problem.

You can view the problem here: [Cheapest Flight Activity Repl](https://replit.com/@adadev/graphs-p2-practice)

### Breakout Rooms - Cheapest Flight 

In small groups of 3-4 students, implement Cheapest Flights in the replit. Get as far as you can, asking for instructor assistance when needed. You _do not_ need to finish the problem completely. 

**One student** should *fork* the following Repl and share the collab oration link with the rest of the team. If you coded along with the livecode, comment out the class solution before beginning your small group solution. [Cheapest Flight Activity Repl](https://replit.com/@adadev/graphs-p2-practice)


## Livecode - Cheapest Flight

As a class we will walk through solving the Cheapest Flight problem. Be prepared to share your small group work!


#### Exercise

If you finish early, you can take an early break or get started on the project with instructor support in the main room available.
