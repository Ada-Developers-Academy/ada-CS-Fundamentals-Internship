## Overview

Rarely do we need to search through a graph just for the sake of searching. Instead, we use graphs to model real-world problems and then use graph algorithms to solve those problems. Often, additional data will need to be carried along with the graph, and the graph algorithms will need to be modified to take advantage of that data. In this lesson, we'll look at how graph searching can be used as the core of several problem approaches.
